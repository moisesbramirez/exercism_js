# Flatten Array

Write a program that will take a nested list and returns a single list with all values except nill/null

The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any null/nill values. 
 
For Example

input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]

output: [1,2,3,4,5]


## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for JavaScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

    jasmine-node .

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
